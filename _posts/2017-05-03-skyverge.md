<b>Part 1: Create a web page

Add a page to your existing site/blog, or create one using your platform of choice. Add any relevant links (LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub) and answers to the following questions.
</b>

My LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alangshall/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/alangshall/</a>
My Twitter: <a href="https://www.twitter.com/alangshall">https://www.twitter.com/alangshall</a>


<b>Part 2: Tell us about yourself

Include answers to the following somewhere on your page:</b>

<i>Where are you located? </i>

I'm currently in Salt Lake City, Utah, but I'm planning a move with my family to Vancouver, Washington this September.

<i>Why are you looking for a new position?</i>

I'm looking for more flexibility in my work environment.

<i>Can you summarize your remote work experience?</i>

At Lucid, I've been able to work from home when needed and maintain the same level of effectiveness that I've had in the office.

<i>What should we definitely look at in your resume/work experience?</i>

In a customer support role, communication with clients is key. I recommend looking at samples of my writing: a blog on Lucid's
preproduction environment at https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2016/09/06/oh-the-things-preprod-can-do-catching-more-bugs-with-a-production-like-testing-environment/, and a presentation given for professional development at SLCC: https://www.academia.edu/2380214/Student_Centered_Learning_through_Canvas

<i>What’s not on your resume/work experience but you think we should know?</i>

I'm good at complex problem solving and don't give up easily. I have a tendency in my current role to hound developers until
critical issues are resolved. I'm good at gathering and communicating large amounts of information succinctly to stakeholders.

<i>Can you summarize your HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge?</i>

I'm no good at writing my own. I'm not a developer and that's something I know about myself. However, I am good at seeing
errors and other problems in the browser and then communicating them to developers. I'm also good at walking through code
with developers and looking for common problems.

<i>Why do you think you’re a good fit for this role?</i>

I have an excellent communication skillset, I'm tenacious at digging into technical problems and summarizing them for others,
and I learn new skills quickly without prompting from others.

Part 3: A Day in The Life (optional)
</b>
<i>Pre-Sales

Imagine a potential customer emails you with the following question. We don’t yet offer this feature, but their current solution does. How would you respond?

I’m considering switching to Product Customizer. Does your app allow live image previews?"
</i>
Unfortunately that's not something we currently offer. If that's important to you, I can talk with one of our product managers
and see where that might fall in our roadmap.

<i>Fire Alarm

Imagine you’ve just started your workday. You login and see a large number of emails from distraught customers. Clearly, something is happening. What steps do you take?</i>

1. Immediately reassure the customers that we are aware of a problem and are taking immediate steps to resolve it.
2. Communicate to developers / ops that there is an unusual influx of emails and I am investigating the cause. Check to see if there
have been any recent releases that might explain the problem.
3. Look for a systemic issue that is common amongst all the tickets. Attempt to reproduce it myself. Gather any other additional information that might be relevant (logs, metrics, stack traces, etc).
4. Communicate my findings to developers handling the incident.
5. Loop back with customers to communicate that we have isolated the problem and are taking immediate steps to resolve it.
6. Work with developers to test any proposed fixes.
7. Validate the fix with customers.

<i>Step-by-Step

We’d like to get an idea of how you explain concepts and processes. What was the last thing your purchased online? Tell us, step-by-step, how you went about searching, choosing, and completing your purchase.</i>

I recently made a purchase of a Nintendo 3DS for my daughter. She had seen my own 2DS and wanted one for herself.
1. I looked at different styles with her online. She chose the Pikachu yellow edition.
2. Unfortunately, at the time we wanted to purchase it, it was out of stock at most retailers.
3. I tracked down when it was going to be back in stock and watched the retailers that would carry it.
4. When it was available for the regular retail price at GameStop, I ordered it.
